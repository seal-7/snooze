This web application can help you fake yourself in a online meeting while you can take a snooze.

## How to use?

Attach keyword to specific reaction videos, for example when someone say `Do you agree?` you can map a `yes I agree` reaction video to word agree.
You can add as many reaction videos as you want for any words. When no words matches, there is always a base video running on loop.
